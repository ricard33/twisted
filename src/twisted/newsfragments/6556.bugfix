twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver checks received lines' lengths against its MAX_LENGTH only after receiving a complete delimiter.  A line ending in a multi-byte delimiter like '\r\n' might be split by the network, with the first part arriving before the rest; previously, LineReceiver erroneously disconnected if the first part, e.g. 'zzzz....\r' exceeded MAX_LENGTH.   LineReceiver now checks received data against MAX_LENGTH plus the delimiter's length, allowing short reads to complete a line.
